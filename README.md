## Project Description:
Our goal is to improve understanding and predict the impact of severe weather events, particularly on power outages across various regions in the United States. By integrating detailed datasets of historical power outage records and comprehensive storm data from the NOAA SWDI database, this project aims to create predictive models that can use identifiers like storm strength (wind speed, pressure, rainfall, etc.), distance from county to storm center, and historical data insights to predict the probability of a power outage for a county (and, the duration of the power outage).
